# Fibonacci
Calculate and draw the Fibonacci sequence, with a few settings and semi-commented simple code.

Performance not the best because im doing "GetTotalSize()" and "Normalize()" all the time, if someone wants to find a workaround then be my guest.

Disabling all rendering (outline,curve,diagonal) makes calculation instant instead of the massive slowdown.
